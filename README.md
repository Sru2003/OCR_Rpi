# Smart Braille Cell: Real-Time Image-to-Braille Conversion

This project, titled **"Raspberry Pi-Driven Affordable Image-To-Braille Converter for Visually Impaired Users,"** was developed under the **SSIP (Student Startup and Innovation Policy)** initiative and later published in a research paper. It aims to provide real-time **image-to-Braille conversion** to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

The **Smart Braille Cell** system utilizes **optical character recognition (OCR)** and **Raspberry Pi 4** technology to capture text from images and convert it into **Braille characters**. These Braille characters are embossed by solenoids, offering tactile feedback that allows for immediate reading.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Text-to-Braille Conversion**: Converts text from images into Braille characters in real-time for tactile reading.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Uses OCR technology to extract and recognize text from images.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Braille characters are embossed by **electromagnetic solenoids**, providing tactile reading for visually impaired users.
- **Affordable Assistive Technology**: Designed to be a low-cost solution for visually impaired individuals, focusing on accessibility in developing countries like India.
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Provides a compact and efficient platform for integrating the system into daily life.

## Aim and Impact:
The **Smart Braille Cell** system aims to enhance inclusivity in **education** and **daily life** for visually impaired individuals. By utilizing accessible, low-cost technologies, it addresses the need for affordable assistive tools, particularly in **developing countries** where resources for assistive devices may be limited.

## Research Paper:
This system and its development were documented in the paper:  
**“Raspberry Pi-Driven Affordable Image-To-Braille Converter for Visually Impaired Users”**   
Published in the **Springer Conference Series** (CCIS).
